# SP1 - TMB - CityScape Logic

## Project goals

There are 2 goals of this project:
- [ ] Creating a basic documentation for working on and developing the TMB table software created by Jiří Šebele as part of his [diploma thesis](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/101139). While working on this project, we discovered that there wasn't any step-by-step guide on how to work with the SDK provided, or that some parts were needlessly complicated ( for us at least ). We will aim to make a comprehensible guide on how to set up the software so that other people working with this device can start implementing their own ideas as soon as possible.
- [ ] In tandem with the guide, we will also start to develop a basic foundation for our city planning project inspired by [MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jvmoj7pLZU) as decribed in the attached google docs.
